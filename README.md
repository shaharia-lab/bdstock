## ü§î  What is BDStock?

**BD Stock Market** a.k.a **bdstock** is a command-line tool and a library in Go to collect and provide stock price 
information for Bangladeshi stock exchange market. Currently, it provides the stock information only for
[Dhaka Stock Exchange](https://www.dsebd.org).

## Use as a library

### Get stock price for a single Company

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"github.com/shahariaazam/bdstock/pkg/stock"
)

func main() {
	bds := stock.NewStock("https://www.dsebd.org/", false)
	si := bds.GetStockInformation("1JANATAMF")
	fmt.Printf("closing price for %s is %s\n", si.StockCode, si.ClosingPrice)
}
```

### Get stock prices for multiple Company

Also, if you want to get the stock information for many companies at once in a batch,

```go
bd := stock.NewStock("https://www.dsebd.org/", false)
si := bd.GetDataInBatch([]string{"1JANATAMF", "NAVANAPHAR"}, 20)
for _, s := range si {
    fmt.Printf("closing price for %s is %s\n", s.StockCode, s.ClosingPrice)
}
```

In the above code, it would fetch and parse all the stock price in a batch mode (per batch 20)
